		<p class="cap">Designing a book cover is basically my absolute dream job, so when <a href="http://awfulagent.com">Awful Agent</a> approached me about doing some covers for ebooks they were putting out, I was of course delighted! It&rsquo;s not quite as glamorous as a real-live physical book cover, but it&rsquo;s close. Designing an ebook cover presents its own unique challenges.</p>
		
		<p>My first assignment was a series of three covers, for Randall Garret&rsquo;s much-loved Lord Darcy series, a fantasy trilogy set in an alternate version of Victorian England. They were looking for simple, striking covers that would fit together well. I developed a simple template, then used colour and imagery to differentiate the titles.</p>
		
		<p>After that, I worked on a pseudo-non-fiction &ldquo;field guide&rdquo; to werewolves. The book is rather tongue-in-cheek, with a satirical feel to it.  I decided to model its cover after vintage field guides, with some blood spatter to make it a bit more gruesome.</p>
