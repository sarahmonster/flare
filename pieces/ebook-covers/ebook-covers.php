		<p class="cap">Designing a book cover is basically my absolute dream job, so when Awful Agent approached me about doing some covers for ebooks they were putting out, I was of course delighted! It&rsquo;s not quite as glamorous as a real-live physical book cover, but it&rsquo;s close. Designing an ebook cover presents its own unique challenges.</p>
		
		<p>My first assignment was a series of three covers, for Randall Garret&rsquo;s much-loved Lord Darcy series, a fantasy trilogy set in an alternate version of Victorian England. They were looking for simple, striking covers that would fit together well. I developed a simple template, then used colour and imagery to differentiate the titles.</p>
