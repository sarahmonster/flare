		<p class="cap">Paul is the author of a new urban fantasy series about Catholic vampire hunters. (Sounds crazy, but it totally works.) He approached me looking for a website. Intrigued by his new spin on the genre&mdash;dear everyone: less <em>Twilight</em>, please!&mdash;I was more than happy to help.</p>

		<p>He already had a cover design for his first title, and wanted the site to fit. I extracted elements from the cover design and used them as background elements, using a moody monochrome colour palette to ensure the covers would stand out.</p>

		<p>The Catholic vampire theme is unique enough that it bears to be capitalized upon. I added icons to the menu that had a distinctly Catholic flair. We built the whole site to be responsive, so it adapts for tablets and phones, as well as desktops.</p>

		<p>Sarah was a pleasure to work with. She was friendly and explained each stage of the web-​​design process as it unfolded (no easy task for an oft-​​befuddled history major), and the end result was everything I could have hoped for. Thoroughly professional work and someone I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend for those looking for a quality website.</p>
