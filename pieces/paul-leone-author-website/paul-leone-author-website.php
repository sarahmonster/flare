		<p class="cap">Paul came to me when he was looking to publicize his new self-published series, a new urban fantasy series about Catholic vampire hunters. Appreciating a new spin on the genre, (Dear everyone: less <em>Twilight</em>, please!) I was more than happy to help him.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;d already had the cover for his first title designed, and wanted the site to fit. I used the source imagery, rebuilt it a bit, and worked some of the imagery into the background of the page. </p>

		<p>I decided to run a bit with the Catholic vampires theme, and added icons to the menu that had a distinctly Catholic flair. Handy that that just naturally seemed to fit with the vampire theme, as well!</p>

		<p>Sarah was a pleasure to work with. She was friendly and explained each stage of the web-​​design process as it unfolded (no easy task for an oft-​​befuddled history major), and the end result was everything I could have hoped for. Thoroughly professional work and someone I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend for those looking for a quality website.</p>
