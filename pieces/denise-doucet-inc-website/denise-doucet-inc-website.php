		<p class="cap">Denise needed a simple, brochure-style site that would serve to advertise and inform about her brand-new government relations firm. Her request was for something elegant, simple, and clean that could be expanded to feature more content and functionality in the future. </p>

		<p>Naturally, I built her a WordPress site. While the site doesn't currently make use of WordPress' blogging functionality, this could easily be activated. When I suggested that we make it responsive, she was immediately amenable to the idea. The end result is a site that's simple, clean, and professional, while still letting Denise's personality shine through.</p>

		<p>In the process of designing the site, we'd developed a simple, but strong, logotype. I provided Denise with a few variants of this to use across different media. Then I expanded it a bit, and created a circular variant that would be more appropriate for certain situations (Facebook page, etc).</p>

		<p class="cap">Since the project seemed largely straightforward, I took advantage of the opportunity to learn a few new tricksâ€”prinarily, employing a new WordPress starter theme and finally learning SASS. I use both now as a default for all new WordPress sites.</p>
