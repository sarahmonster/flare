		<p class="cap">Denise came to me looking for a simple, brochure-style site that would serve to advertise and inform about her brand-new government relations firm. Her request was for something elegant, simple, and clean that could be expanded to feature more content and functionality in the future. </p>
	
		<span class="date url-link">&middot; <a href="http://denisedoucetinc.com">denisedoucetinc.com</a> &middot; </span>
	
		<p>We started by building her a custom WordPress site, careful to keep the structure as flexible as possible, in anticipation of future expansion. I suggested we opt for a responsive design, especially since many of her clients would be browsing their site on their phones. The end result is a site that's simple, clean, and professional, while still letting Denise's personality shine through.</p>

	<div class="nineecol" style="padding-top: 40px;">
		<p>In the process of designing the site, we&rsquo;d developed a simple&mdash;but strong&mdash;logotype. I provided Denise with a few variants of this to use across different media. Since the logo is quite rectangular, I also created a circular variant that would be more appropriate for certain situations. This variant works well as an icon, or for a Facebook page, or anywhere where you need a logo to be more square in proportion, giving Denise more flexibility with her branding.</p>

		<p class="cap">Since the project seemed largely straightforward, I took advantage of the opportunity to learn a few new tricks. I used a new WordPress starter theme, after careful evaluation of the options available. While I was at it, I finally taught myself to use SASS, which has improved my development practises immensely. I now use both as a default for all new WordPress sites.</p>
