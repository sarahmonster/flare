		<p class="cap">Samara is a new young adult author. Her books are full of adventure and fantasy, and she wanted a website design that would reflect that in a dreamy, stylish way. On the technical side, she wanted a site that would be as flexible and easy-to-update as possible.</p>

		<p>I worked with Samara to design a WordPress theme, using customized stock illustrations to give a whimsical, fairy-tale feel. The girl at the top of the page, reading on the moon, is mirrored in the footer as a mermaid to lend a feeling of continuity between sky and water. Typography was chosen carefully to feel at once both friendly and stylish.</p>

		<p>As a new author on the block, I needed a website that would help my work stand out from the crowd and allow me to build an online platform. Sarah gave me all that and more, taking a rough design concept and a very long wish-list and turning it into a reality. She provided help and support every step of the way, with a two-way design process that took all of my feedback into account, and quickly answered all of my technical questions. I'm thrilled with my new website and I'm so glad I decided to work with Sarah!</p>
