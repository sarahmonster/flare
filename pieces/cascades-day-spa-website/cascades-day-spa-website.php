		<p class="cap">Cascades Day Spa is one of Halifax&rsquo;s longest-running and most well-known day spas. They have a loyal clientele and an excellent reputation, but their old website just wasn't pulling its weight anymore. Built on a Contribute platform, it was difficult to update, hard to navigate, and had a design that was severely out-of-date. They approached me knowing the site needed an overhaul in order to have a website that was in line with their business, and that would allow for continued growth.</p>
		
	<p>Kim requested that the site be simple, clean, and easy to navigate. At the same time, she knew that she needed something that would be accessible on phones and tablets. Of primary importance were the gift certificates and the book online functionality, both of which needed to be as easy to use as possible from both a client and a company perspective.

	<p>After evaluating her precise needs from an administrative point of view, I suggested a few options for online gift certificates, set up a simple form for booking an appointment, and created a custom WordPress installation. Promotions are managed as a special post type, allowing for easy entry without replicating the same content.</p>
	
	<p>Simple isn't always as easy as it seems. A particular challenge inherent in this site was developing style rules that would work across a variety of different pages. Many of the pages are structured as price lists, and I played around with the rules quite a few times before settling on a set of rules that worked consistently and displayed well across all pages. The resulting lists are both aesthetically appealing and easily scanned.</p>
