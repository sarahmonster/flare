	<p class="cap">Note that I am often out of the country. Telephone, carrier pigeon, and showing-up-on-my-doorstep are typically extremely ineffective ways of getting in touch with me. Email, on the other hand, is always with me, even when I'm driving through clifftops in Chile, exploring the markets of Morocco, or trekking through Thailand.</p>
