	<h3>Wordpress websites</h3>
	<p>WordPress is used on over 60 million websites, including almost 20% of the world’s top sites, and with good reason: it's flexible, expandable, and easy-to-use! I build most of my websites using Wordpress. This means you'll be able to update your website as easily as your Facebook status. I customize the site to your particular needs and make sure it's as simple as possible for you to edit and update.</p>
	
	<h3>Responsive design</h3>
	<p>With more and more people now accessing the internet on a mobile device, it is rapidly becoming more vital to offer a site that’s optimized for these devices. A well thought-out responsive design will give you a website that adapts to the size of the device it's being shown on. </p>
	
	<h3>Domain and hosting</h3> 
	<p>Don't know what this means? Don't you worry about a thing. I've got it covered. I run my own lightning-fast servers, optimized for WordPress, and keep everything secure and up-to-date for you.</p>
	
	<h3>Interface design (UI/UX)</h3>
	<p>Great interfaces mean that people feel happy using your product. I design beautiful, usable interfaces for web and mobile apps, taking into consideration user needs.</p>
	
	<h3>Email newsletters &amp; Social Media Integration</h3> 
	<p>Want to mass-mail three thousand of your closest friends? I'm well-versed in MailChimp templates, and can create a newsletter template that will degrade well across a variety of email clients. I can also make sure your website interacts well (and matches with) your various social media accounts. </p>
	
	<h3>Logos & branding</h3> 
	<p>First impressions <em>do</em> count. People <em>do</em> judge a book by its cover. The first thing your customers see of you is your logo. What is it telling them? One you've got a logo, you need a business card, letterhead, and maybe a whole range of other materials. I can make sure your look is consistent throughout, so everything just fits right.</p>

	<h3>Printed promotions</h3> 
	<p>Brochures, advertisements, mailouts, stickers, t-shirts, flyers, postcards, newsletters, packaging—don't just put your logo on it, make it look lovely to boot. If you can print it out, or show it on a screen, I can make it eye-catching and gorgeous.</p>

	<h3>Resumes</h3>
	<p>A beautifully designed and well-written resume will get your foot in the door.</p>
	
	<h3>Information design</h3> 
	<p>Your menus, signs, posters, annual reports, and wedding invitations will have so much more panache if they're professionally designed.</p>

	<p class="cap">From logos to websites, and everything in between: when it comes to design, whatever your needs, I've got you covered!</p>

	<p>Additionally, if there's something I <em>don't</em> do, I've developed strategic partnerships with a whole host of brilliant people. Need an illustration? Copywriting? Search engine optimization? Photography? Custom programming? I know a guy. (Or five.)</p>

	<p>Oh, and if you already <em>know</em> a guy, I play well with others.</p>


	<p class="cap">How does it all work? Well, my design process is all about <em>you</em>. We start by figuring out precisely what you need. Some clients know exactly what they want and just need their vision made into reality. Others need design help from the ground up.</p>

	<p>Either way, we'll begin with talking about you and your business. Who's your target market? What are their values, how do they live their lives, and what do they think is important? Who are your competitors and how do you stand out from them? What sort of image are you trying to project? What sort of image do you currently maintain? There are a lot of questions!</p>

	<p>When all the talking (or emailing, as the case may be) is done, the work starts. First off: rough mockup designs based on everything we talked about. From there, it's a back-and-forth process of revisions, combining and refining elements until it all comes together into a design you're sure to love.</p>
