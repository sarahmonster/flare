		<p>From logos to websites, and everything in between: when it comes to design, whatever your needs, I've got you covered!</p>

			<h3>Logos &amp; branding</h3> 
			<p>A great logo should tell the world, with a simple line or shape, what you're all about. Once you've got a logo, you need a business card, letterhead, and maybe a whole range of other materials. I can make sure your look is consistent throughout, so everything just fits right.</p>
