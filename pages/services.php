		<p>I've been in business a long time, and that means that there are a <strong>lot</strong> of things I do. I specialize in custom WordPress sites, but there's a whole lot more that I can do. I'm either a very technical designer, or a very aesthetically-inclined developer&mdash;depending on who you ask&mdash;so you can count on me to deliver something as functional as it is beautiful.</p>
		
		<p>It might be shorter to give you a list of the things I <em>don't</em> do: Flash, SEO, back-end development, or waste anyone's time. I've developed strategic partnerships with a whole host of brilliant people. Need an illustration? Copywriting? Search engine optimization? Photography? Custom programming? I know a guy. (Oh, and if you already <em>know</em> a guy, I play well with others.)</p>
