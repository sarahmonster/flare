	<p class="cap">Hello there. I'm Sarah. I like beautiful things, and I try to make the world around me as gorgeous as it can be.</p>
	
	<p>I've been into design for as long as I can remember. I wrote, designed, and illustrated my first picture book when I was four. At fourteen, I taught myself to build websites so that I could share my angsty teenaged poetry with the outside world. My first summer job was as a website designer for a software company.</p>

	<p>But I always figured you couldn't make a respectable living making pretty things. That's how I found myself working a string of menial jobs (including crossing guard, knife salesman, security guard, maid, and gas-station barista) while trying desperately to put myself through a philosophy degree.</p>

	<p>I convinced a local community college to let me do a two-year diploma program in one. The idea was that I'd maybe manage to make enough money as a designer to go back to university, and then I could graduate and get a real job.</p>

	<p>But then I fell utterly, absolutely, completely, head-over-heels in love.</p>

	<p class="cap">For a while, I worked for a video game development studio in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. I didn't want to run my own business, but I continued to do freelance work on the side. Eventually, my freelance work started to equal a full-time job. I had to choose.</p>
I chose the uncertain route, and I haven't looked back since. Since I started Triggers &amp; Sparks in 2006, I've had the opportunity to work with a whole range of different companies and individuals, big and small, to help realize them their potential through quality design. Some of these people have lived next door, others have lived all the way across the world.

	<p>Somewhere along the line, I ran off to Mexico for a week, and I fell in love again. This time, my paramour was travel. I realized that I could run my business from anywhere in the world, so long as I had a laptop and a reliable internet connection. Every new trip became a litmus test, and I changed the rules each time I left home. I went to Europe for five weeks; I lived in Argentina for five months; and I spent nine months circumnavigating the globe. Through all of that, I've learned to communicate via email and Skype, to deal with odd timezone mismatches, and to manage a project effectively without the need for in-person meetings or on-site supervision. My clients don't worry that I'm halfway around the world—they just drop me a line to ask where I am today. So, wherever you may be in the world, I'm here for you!</p>

	<p class="cap">Triggers &amp; Sparks was borne out of a desire to make the world a more beautiful place—one logo, website, or poster at a time. I believe that good design ought to speak, and it ought to say something about you. My aim is to create exactly what <em>you</em> want, and my portfolio features a wide array of styles for precisely this reason. Good design cannot exist within a vacuum, and the client (that's you!), is as much a part of the process as the designer.</p>

	<p>I believe my work speaks for itself—so check out my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>, take a look at <a href="/clients">past clients' testimonials</a>, and contact me for a <a href="/contact">no-strings quote</a>.</p>

	<p>Then sit back and watch the sparks fly!</p>
